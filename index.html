						<h2>Nice to meet you. <span class="emoji-accent">ü§ù</span></h2>
						<p>I help growing product companies plan for the future using design thinking, human centred design, systems thinking and Lean methodologies. I love research and validating ideas with users to decrease risk and solve real problems, but I also love seeing ideas through and working closely with implementation teams to build robust solutions that scale.</p>

						<p>My background is technical (I was a front-end engineer) so I'm well-versed in various Javascript frameworks like React, Hoplon (Clojurescript), Angular and Vue, as well as PHP, HTML/CSS, and CMS/LMS frameworks like Drupal, edX, Canvas, etc.</p>

						<p>I am an Agile advocate and have many years of experience in Agile teams, mainly Scrum. I have taught Agile/Scrum courses and am an experienced facilitator of Scrum rituals.</p>

						<p>I believe in the power of design systems and design ops and have been advocating for component-driven front-ends everywhere I work.</p>

						<p>I've run my own business (both product and consulting) as an entrepreneur, and I've managed teams of designers, developers and other collaborators. I'm passionate about progressive, modern leadership, diversity, inclusion and frictionless productivity.</p>

						<p>Also, I teach, speak and write about design and am an active member of my local design community. I'm based in Melbourne but am dreaming of moving to the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

						<p>You may notice a conspicuous lack of financial institutions, Big 4 consultancies and famous multinationals on my CV. That's by design; I'm careful about where I work and I'm looking for purpose-driven product organisations working to make the world better. Sustainability and diversity in particular are meaningful for me, and I am working on moving my career towards more meaningful and impactful work.</p>

						<p>My role is to champion user research, mentor budding UXers, create design systems and introduce the whole organisation to the practice of UX.</p>

								<p>As a Senior UX Designer at <a href="http://online.rmit.edu.au" target="_blank">RMIT Online</a> I have established multiple UX processes and feedback loops to help bring student and teacher feedback into the process of building new courses and refining the delivery model. I have developed design ops templates and processes around end of first run depth interviews, usability testing for learning activity design, led the design guild, and also developed a component-driven approach and refactor for the HTML/CSS front-end of online courses in the edX LMS, including moving their existing code to Sass and Git. I am overseeing a platform migration and helping to develop resources and tools to increase engagement through a series of measurable Lean experiments. I've also increased their survey response rates through survey design improvements and have developed a centralised feedback repository where insights from interviews, surveys and emails are collected, collated and labelled in a transparent way so teams can draw on them in their sprint planning or instantly solve problems as hotfixes.</p>

								<p>I was Director of product and design at a rapidly evolving CX startup <a href="https://www.rateitapp.com/" target="_blank">RateIt</a> where I managed a team of software engineers, a junior product manager and a graphic designer. I hired a senior UXer, started their component library and design system, shifted a team into a productive agile process, created a practice of human-centred design and was a damn good manager. I was part of the senior leadership team and helped shape strategy, OKRs and culture.</p>

						<h2>Want to make cool stuff with me? <span class="emoji-accent">ü§ô</span></h2>
						<p>I'm looking impactful, meaningful and ethical work. I'm keen to work with small organisations, particularly those with a commitment to sustainability, diversity and inclusion, and especially those led by women.</p>
						<p>I'm interested in leadership roles and advisory opportunities, and am keen to chat to you if your organisation is led by human-centred design principles.</p>
						<p>My day rate starts at $1000 AUD (+GST). For full-time roles I'm interested in salaries of $140K and above. (I believe that being transparent about pay makes it <a href=
							"https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2014.0950?journalCode=orsc&" target="_blank">fairer for everyone</a>) I'm keen to work in Melbourne, Australia and potentially beyond - remote and flexible commitments are appealing.</p>
						<p>I'm usually doing something important with my time, but I'm always keen to chat. <a href="#nine">Get in touch.</a></p>
